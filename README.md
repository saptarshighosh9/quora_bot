QUORA BOT 
=========

Trying to automate various tasks on Quora.

SERIAL UPVOTER ( Tested on Python 2.7) 
=============================================================================================

Instructions : 

* Download serial_upvoter.py and config.ini and put them in the same folder. 
* Try to install Python 2 and install two modules ConfigParser and Selenium and install Chromedriver for selenium if you want to automate the task over chrome. 
* Change the parameters of the configuration file as per your requirement and you're done. Run the file serial_upvoter.py and wait for chrome to open up and enjoy the show. ;) 
* Change the value of parameter 'up_vote' to any value other than 'add' to remove all the upvotes and keep as it is to upvote all the answers. 
* Remove the parameter pass_word from the config file if you don't want to add your password in a file and you will get a prompt to enter your password. 

You can upvote all the answers of your crush using this script serial_upvoter.py. 
It will automate the task of manuall upvoting each answer using browser automation tool Selenium. 
You can make all this run in background using PhantomJs() Webdriver in Selenium.
